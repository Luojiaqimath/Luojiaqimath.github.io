I am currently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Soochow University. My research focuses on using nonlinear optimization techniques and machine learning methods to develop simple, user-friendly, and computationally efficient models and algorithms that can tackle complex real-world problems in industry, healthcare, and science. By combining insights from mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge, I aim to create innovative solutions that practitioners can readily adopt and implement.
